# Hello, World

Every developer blog starts the same way — with a "hello world" post about why the author is starting a blog, what they'll write about, and a promise to post regularly. I'm going to do exactly that, but with a twist.

## The Challenge

I'm taking on the **50 Projects in 50 Days** challenge. The rules are simple:

1. Build one small project every day for 50 days
2. It has to be *finished* (or at least shippable) by the end of the day
3. Write a short post about what I learned

The goal isn't to build 50 production apps. It's to sharpen instincts, get comfortable with unfamiliar APIs and libraries, and practice shipping quickly without perfectionism getting in the way.

## Why Public?

Accountability. When I commit to something publicly it becomes much harder to quietly abandon it. Plus, if anything I build turns out to be useful to someone else, that's a bonus.

## The Stack

This site itself is Project Zero in a sense. It's built with:

- **Next.js 15** (App Router)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — first time using v4 properly
- **MDX** via `next-mdx-remote` for this blog

The dark theme, bold typography, and colorful accents are intentional. I spend a lot of time in terminals and dark editors; I wanted the portfolio to feel at home there.

## What's Next

Day 1 starts tomorrow. I'm planning to start with some UI/interaction challenges before moving into more functional projects. The full tracker is on the [50 Projects page](/50projects).

Let's build.
